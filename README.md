# Lower-limb-Exoskeleton-controller

This project was done by Damien GUENERS as part of end of study internship supervised by Gijs Van Oort from the University of Twente.
This is a simulation of a gait controller for a lower limb exoskeleton based on the Divergent Component of Motion.
The SimMechanics body model is a modified version of M. Dekker model with 10 DoF.
The controller use the Divergent Component of Motion from J. Englsberger.
